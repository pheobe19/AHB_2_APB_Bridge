# AHB_2_APB_Bridge
This repository contains the design and verification environment for an AHB-to-APB bridge, which connects an AMBA AHB master to an AMBA Peripheral Bus (APB) slave. The bridge converts high-speed pipelined AHB transactions into simpler APB accesses, enabling communication between high-performance cores and low-speed peripherals.
